# Command `bucketmetadata`

Retrieves metadata from an S3 Bucket (v2 SDK only) by probing the store, provided
the caller has the permission to issue this request -sometimes it is disabled.

For S3 Express buckets, this includes the Availability Zone in which the region is deployed, as well as its type (which will be `AvailabilityZone`).

For S3 standard buckets, the location type and name will be `null`.

Although it is possible to identify S3 Express buckets by their name, this is not the case when referenced through AWS Access Points; this probe against the store will 

## Example: S3 Standard

```
 bin/hadoop jar $CLOUDSTORE bucketmetadata s3a://example-london/

Getting bucket info for s3a://example-london/
=============================================

Bucket metadata from S3
Region eu-west-2
Location Name null
Location Type null
```

The bucket region is eu-west-2; it has no location type or name.

## Example: Access point

Here an access point is used to reference the same bucket, using the per bucket-option
`fs.s3a.bucket.example-ap.accesspoint.arn` of a "virtual" bucket name `example-ap`
to remap the request to the Access Point.

```xml
  <property>
    <name>fs.s3a.bucket.example-ap.accesspoint.arn</name>
    <value>arn:aws:s3:eu-west-2:152813711128:accesspoint/ap-example-london</value>
    <description>AccessPoint bound to example-ap which relays to example-london</description>
  </property>
```

The response indicates that this is mapped to an S3 Standard bucket.

```
bin/hadoop jar cloudstore-1.0.jar bucketmetadata s3a://example-ap

Getting bucket info for s3a://example-ap
========================================

2024-09-25 11:24:32,908 [main] INFO  s3a.S3AFileSystem (S3AFileSystem.java:initialize(578)) - Using AccessPoint ARN "arn:aws:s3:eu-west-2:152813711128:accesspoint/ap-example-london" for bucket example-ap
Bucket metadata from S3
Region eu-west-2

Location Type null
```


## Example: S3 Express

When probing an S3 Express bucket, the location type and name is returned.

```
hadoop jar cloudstore-1.0.jar bucketmetadata s3a://example--usw2-az1--x-s3

Getting bucket info for s3a://example--usw2-az1--x-s3
=====================================================

Bucket metadata from S3
Region us-west-2
Location Name usw2-az1
Location Type AvailabilityZone
```

## Third Party stores

The result of the probe against third party stores is undefined, and will vary with the store.

Here is an example response from a probe of a Dell ECS store:

```
bin/hadoop jar cloudstore-1.0.jar bucketmetadata s3a://ecsbucket/

Getting bucket info for s3a://ecsbucket/
=========================================

Bucket metadata from S3
Region null
Location Name null
Location Type null

```
