## S3 Versioned Object support

AWS S3 supports [object versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html),
where old copies of objects are retained after being overwritten or deleted.

The versioned object commands use AWS SDK operations not directly accessible
through the Hadoop Filesystem APIs to view and retrieve versioned
objects.

Points to note
* This is lower level and a bit brittle.
* S3A Auditing is bypassed.
* If custom S3A signers are used, they need to able to handle S3 Requests (ListVersions) which
  are not normally used.
* The caller must be in an IAM Role with the permissions to invoke this, and for `undelete` to be able
  to delete versioned objects.

# Command `listversions`

Lists all versions of files under a path.

## Usage

```
hadoop jar cloudstore-1.0.jar listversions
Usage: listversions <path>
        -D <key=value>  Define a property
        -deleted        include delete markers
        -dirs   include directory markers
        -limit <limit>  limit of files to list
        -out <file>     output file
        -q      quiet output
        -separator <string>     Separator if not <tab>
        -age <seconds>  Only include versions created in this time interval
        -since <epoch-time>     Only include versions after this time
        -tokenfile <file>       Hadoop token file to load
        -verbose        print verbose output
        -xmlfile <file> XML config file to load


```

## list to a file

```bash
hadoop jar cloudstore-1.0.jar listversions -out out.tsv -limit 10  s3a://stevel-london/
```

Exports a version listing as a tab separated file. Any hadoop filesystem URI is supported as a destination.

## Table column meaning

| **column** | **type** | **meaning** |
|-----|------|---------|
| `index` | `long` | index in table |
| `key` | `string` | bucket key |
| `path` | `URI` | Hadoop Path |
| `restore` | `boolean` |  restore this? |
| `latest` | `boolean` | is this the latest? |
| `tombstone` | `boolean` | tombstone marker? |
| `directory` | `boolean` | directory marker? |
| `date` | `string` | date |
| `timestamp` | `long` | epoch timestamp  |
| `version` | `string` | version reference or "" for unversioned file |
| `etag` | `string` | etag or "" for tombstones |

The `restore` column is a cue for restoring an object; it is set to true for hidden keys which aren't markers or tombstones

## Summarizing a bucket

The `-q` option scans a bucket but only prints the summary

```

hadoop jar cloudstore-1.0.jar listversions -q  s3a://stevel-london/
2023-03-01 17:37:43,931 [main] INFO  extra.ListVersions (StoreDurationInfo.java:<init>(56)) - Starting: listversions
2023-03-01 17:37:44,622 [main] WARN  s3a.S3AFileSystem (S3AFileSystem.java:getAmazonS3ClientForTesting(1221)) - Access to S3A client requested, reason listversions

Listing s3a://stevel-london/
============================


Found 9,594 objects under s3a://stevel-london/ with total size 23,720,367 bytes
Hidden file count 2,451 with hidden data size 23,720,367 bytes
Hidden zero-byte file count 424
Hidden directory markers 2,123
Tombstone entries 5,017 comprising 2,463 files and 2,554 dir markers
2023-03-01 17:37:47,663 [main] INFO  extra.ListVersions (StoreDurationInfo.java:close(115)) - Duration of listversions: 0:03:733
```

This summary shows some aspects of a bucket only used for `hadoop-aws` test runs, where all data is cleaned
up after each test case. This means that there is at least one tombstone per file created during
a test run.

* A bucket may be empty yet actually contain billed data -here 23MB.
* Directory markers tombstones may be a large fraction of the data.
  This is because the S3 client will issue "blind" DELETE requests for
  compatibility with older releases whenever files are created/renamed underneath a path.
  Disable this by setting `fs.s3a.directory.marker.retention` to `keep`.
  This option is faster to write files on an unversioned bucket and significantly improves listing performance
  on versioned buckets.

## Restoring a whole list

Taking a TSV file and restoring all those files with restore=1 to a different location is yet to be implemented.


## `restore` command

A single file can be restored using the `restore` command, which will take a file and version
and create a new copy in a different location in the same bucket.

```bash
> hadoop jar cloudstore-1.0.jar restore s3a://stevel-london/FileSystemContractBaseTest "zn8c734o2CaH2ZfsS.I7_mpDl6kgh63O" /restored.txt

restoring s3a://stevel-london/FileSystemContractBaseTest @ zn8c734o2CaH2ZfsS.I7_mpDl6kgh63O to s3a://stevel-london/restored.txt
Starting: restore
Duration of restore: 0:00:715
Restored object of size 2,048 bytes to s3a://stevel-london/restored.txt
```

## `undelete` command

"undeletes" S3 objects by removing directory tombstones from a bucket path.

By undeleting all tombstones added since a specific date, all objects deleted after that
point in time will become visible.

Usage
```
 undelete 
        -D <key=value>  Define a property
        -limit <limit>  limit of files to list
        -age <seconds>  Only include versions created in this time interval
        -since <epoch-time>     Only include versions after this time
        -tokenfile <file>       Hadoop token file to load
        -xmlfile <file> XML config file to load
```

### Example

Preparation: create then delete a file 

```bash
# create a file
> hadoop fs -touch s3a://stevel-london/undelete.txt

# delete it
> bin/hadoop fs -rm  s3a://stevel-london/undelete.txt
Deleted s3a://stevel-london/undelete.txt

# list versions including tombstones

The object `s3a://stevel-london/undelete.txt` at version "ZJMKH.5PrEwiy9z1HbDqPHOaTxhUkhxC" is not visible as there is a tombstone above it.

Calling the undelete command will remove the tombstone

```bash
hadoop jar cloudstore-1.0.jar undelete s3a://stevel-london/undelete.txt

Note that there may be multiple tombstones one on top of each other *without any intervening file*.
All these tombstones need to be removed before the file becomes visible.
Deleting tombstones *older* than the most recent file does not affect the
visibility of the file.
