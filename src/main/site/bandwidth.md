statistics. Save the summary to a CSV file for review.

```
> hadoop jar cloudstore-1.0.jar bandwidth -csv tmp/s3a128m.csv -block 8 -verbose -policy whole-file 128m s3a://stevel-london/tmp

CSV formatted data saved to tmp/s3a128m.csv

```

This example was executed on hadoop 3.3.4 against a remote AWS S3 store.

Note how most of the upload happened in the `close()` call.
This is typical when the data being written is generated faster than the upload bandwidth
of the uplink; the `close()` call blocks until the upload is complete.

This is also why application code which assumes that closing a stream is fast is at risk
of problems when this happens, such as timing out if heartbeats are required to be
generated during the upload.


## CSV output

The CSV file records the operations which have taken place, bytes processed and duration.

### Columns



| Column    | Meaning                         |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| operation | operation which took place      |
| bytes     | bytes processed in operation    |
| total     | total bytes in ongoing sequence |
| duration  | duration in milliseconds        |

### operations

| Operation         | Meaning                                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| create-file       | file creation                                    |
| upload-block      | upload an individual block                       |
| close-upload      | close() the output stream to complete the upload |
| upload            | total upload time                                |
| open-for-download | open the file for download                       |
| download-block    | download an individual block                     |
| download          | total download time                              |

### CSV example

Here the the CSV output from the previous example.

Note how the upload operations initially take on a few milliseconds,
but there are some which take seconds.

This operation is to the AWS S3 store, where writes are done in blocks; the 99 mS delay on
block four is probably the multipart upload being initiated and the first block being asynchronously
queued for upload. The threshold is set in `fs.s3a.multipart.size`
```xml

  <property>
    <name>fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks</name>
    <value>2</value>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>fs.s3a.multipart.size</name>
    <value>32M</value>
  </property>

```
The next big delays of 110993 and 8248 ms are due not to blocks being uploaded, but
in waiting for the block queue to have space to queue another asynchronous block upload
-that is, to wait for an ongoing upload to complete.

The `close-upload` operation is when the upload completes and all buffers being
written to are complete, then the final multipart operation is finished.

On S3A, for data below the multipart threshold, all the upload takes place in the close() call.
(Excluding the "magic" uploads of the magic s3a committer; these are always multipart writes.)

The download bandwidth in this experiment (Macbook Pro M1; WiFi) is less than the upload.
This is because a single HTTP stream is being used for download; there is no parallelism
and the application has to wait for data to be streamed in.

There are two ways in some recent Hadoop releases to speed this up.
* Vector IO (hadoop-3.3.5): parallelized reads of explicit ranges; out of order arrival.
  This requires application/library code to be aware of the API to explicitly use it.
* Prefetching (hadoop-3.3.6): prefetching blocks of data in parallel GET requests.
  This requires no application changes, but is less optimal for parquet/orc libraries
  if they have explicit support for vector IO

```

The changed upload settings: smaller blocks and a bigger queue actually seemed to slow down the upload performance.

Possible causes
1. Changes in test setup; the benchmarks should be done with a physical ethernet connection and no other network traffic
2. More blocks == more HTTPS connections to set up with TLS negotiation and flow control ramp up delays
3. Contention for bandwidth between the multiple streams.

Download time was *significantly* faster, more than doubling its bandwidth.

The CSV file implies that most blocks were written straight to disk cache;
one block write blocked for 49 seconds waiting for more capacity.

```

Download performance shows a slow read for the first blocks, but then subsequent reads are either very fast (data already downloaded and cached to disk), or a read needs to complete.

Again, more experiments would be needed to reach conclusions here.
