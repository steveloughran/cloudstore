# Command `mkbucket`

Creates a bucket.

Usage
```
Usage: mkbucket <region> <S3A path>
```

```bash
hadoop jar cloudstore-1.0.jar mkbucket us-east-2 s3a://new-bucket-name/
```

The per-bucket settings of the target bucket name are used to create the bucket,
for example the endpoint and login details.
However, if you are attempting complex configurations, e.g. creating buckets for
a different account, it is a lot safer to set the base configuration options.
