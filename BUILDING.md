# Building

With maven, with profiles for many different hadoop versions.

To build a production release
1. Use java8
1. And compile against a shipping hadoop version, with `-Pextra` for the extra stuff


```bash
mvn clean install -Phadoop-3.3.2 -Pextra
```

## Releasing

To publish the release use the gui or the github command line

```bash
set -gx now (date '+%Y-%m-%d')
echo [$now]
git add .
git status
git commit -S -m "release $now"
git push
gh release create tag-release-$now -t release-$now -n "release of $now" -d target/cloudstore-1.0.jar
# then go to the web ui to review and finalize the relese
```

* If a new release is made the same day, remember to create a new tag
* The version `cloudstore-1.0.jar` is always used, not just from laziness but because it allows
for bash scripts to always be able to fetch the latest version through curl then execute it.
